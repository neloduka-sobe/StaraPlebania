    paragraph1: 'We don\'t know when the history of Stara Plebania begins. However, it is known that until 1946 the building served as a local rectory, where the pastor lived with his family. We learned the history of the previous residents from the son of the last pastor - it inspired us to breathe life into this beautiful place.',
    paragraph2: 'Since 1946, the building has played various roles, from a home for nuns, through a school for local youth, a shop to social housing. The building was once even a road salt warehouse. Not to mention how it almost burned down once. Over all these years, it slowly lost its original charm and fell into ruin.',
    paragraph3: 'Hearing the history of this house and the entire area, we decided to breathe new life into these tired walls - little else remained. We undertook the mission of restoring Stara Plebania to its former glory. Thus, you are reading this description and can, on your own, discover the beauty and mystery of this place, as we did years ago.',
